This project is my iteration of Bootstrap utilities. I, preferably, do not like Bootstrap. I find it to be too jumbled and complex.
That being said I did my best and went back and forth a lot between the Coding Temple lessons and the Bootstrap website to come up
with something that works. I used basic bootstrap utilities and classes to style the entire page and did not use css since bootstrap
covered the responsiveness in this assignment. I followed the instructions to the best of my ability to get a good looking page. Also
on the Bootstrap website it says that form validation does not work on the client side. Overall I did enjoy working on this assignment.
Once I got the hang of what I was doing, it became less of a headache and I was able to focus and get this done! I used place holder
images via link since there was really no direction for this assignment. I look forward to many more assignments in the future and
am excited to keep on learning!
